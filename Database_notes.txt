Installation update steps for Mongo DB in cloud9

 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2930ADAE8CAF5059EE73BB4B58712A2291FA4AD5


echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.6 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

Now, in order to run mongod you'll first need to cd into root ~ then run ./mongod


Additionally, after you're up and running with mongo, be sure to shut down your ./mongod server each time you're done working. You can do this with ctrl + c 

If you leave it running then Cloud 9 could timeout and cause mongo to crash. If this happens, try the following steps to repair it. 

From the command line, run:

cd ~
./mongod --repair


If you're still having trouble getting it to run then find the /data directory (it should be inside of ~) and cd into it. Once inside, run rm mongod.lock then cd back into ~ and run ./mongod again (see below).

cd ~/data
rm mongod.lock
cd
./mongod
